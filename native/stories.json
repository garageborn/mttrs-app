It is important to us that all members have a positive experience at Movati particularly as we have members of various ages, varying levels of fitness and from different cultural, ethnic and religious backgrounds.

Following Ms. Vecchio's own social media postings on this matter, we conducted a thorough investigation which included first-hand accounts from members and other staff, and a follow-up meeting with Jenna herself, who seemed to leave the facility feeling as though she had expressed her position. Upon conclusion of our interviews, we stand by the original decision that confirms that Ms. Vecchio was dressed inconsistently with our code of conduct. The Movati staff never indicated Ms. Vecchio's style of shirt was not appropriate - it was the lack of coverage that was the issue as she exercised adjacent to other members. While in no way did we mean to embarrass Ms. Vecchio, we did feel it necessary to address the situation with her due to member discomfort .

But unlike Amazon's Echo, Google Home buyers can customize the colors of their always-listening device. In addition, Google Home can control your TV, presumably if it has a Chromecast attached. And because it's from Google, Android users can expect some sort of tie-in between their phone and Home virtual assistant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo firm release date has been announced for Google Home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGoogle Daydream\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle didn't bring us a VR headset like we had hoped. But they did introduce a set of standards for hardware makers to reference while making VR-supporting smartphones. \u003ca href=\"http://www.popsci.com/google-daydream-android-vr-cardboard-release-features\"\u003eGoogle Daydream\u003c/a\u003e will help phone makers like Samsung, LG, HTC, Huawei and more match Google's requirements this fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition to hardware specs, companies interested in making Google Daydream devices will have to adhere to Google's standards for making headsets and controllers as well. A controller the company demoed at I/O 2016 supported motion and offered buttons on its face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe'll start seeing Google Daydream devices this fall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAndroid N\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it wouldn't be a Google keynote without mention of the company's successful smartphone platform. Android has made its way to Android N (which Google has called upon its users \u003ca href=\"https://www.android.com/versions/name-n/\"\u003eto help name\u003c/a\u003e) and is bringing some interesting features to the handset operating system. Multitasking in Android has always allowed multiple apps to run in the background simultaneously, and now they can do so in the foreground. Picture-in-picture allows Android users to put two apps on screen at once to see Twitter while they browse the web, watch a video while tapping out a text, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotifications will see an update in Android N as well. Similar to what early-adopters saw in the Android N preview, users of Google's latest smartphone operating system will be able to reply to messages from within the same app right from the banner notification. Long pressing on the notification will also let you control how often alerts like it surface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid N users will also see security updates such as improvements to encryption on the file level. But one of the most significant improvements is in Android's ability to run apps that users have yet to install. Dubbed Android Instant Apps, users will be able to run certain apps as quickly as accessing a webpage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAllo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAllo will serve as Google's latest communication tool for mobile. In addition to allowing Android users to trade messages, the messenger will support Google's voice assistant features. You can either summon the assistant from within a chat window or text Google's assistant itself. Similar to the assistant found in Google Home, the texting version allows for users to search movie times, gifs and other important information and media useful in the moment. While Allo seems to be Google's answer to Facebook Messenger's recent support of bots, there's currently no word on whether Allo will fall back on SMS like Apple's iMessage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThose looking to go off-the-record will appreciate Allo's incognito mode. Allo doesn't have a firm release date as of yet, but according to Google, it will make its way to devices this summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDuo\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe video counterpart to Allo, Duo will allow users to make one-on-one video calls. The message is tied to your phone number and offers Knock Knock, a feature that gives users a live video preview of the person calling them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app does not allow for video conferencing and offers few buttons. But placing and hanging up a call, and switching between front-facing and rear camera is all Google presumes users needs out of a video chat application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuo will also make its way to phone users this summer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMiscellaneous Google I/O 2016 Updates\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle made mention of other updates as well. \u003ca href=\"http://www.popsci.com/android-wear-20-will-free-your-watch-from-your-phone\"\u003eAndroid Wear 2.0\u003c/a\u003e will bring new features to the wrist with a new UI, an API for third-parties interested in utilizing complications, and more. The company also made mention of their focus on machine learning and bragged about their win in Alpha Go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, many of the updates seen today did not have a firm release date. But Google I/O 2016 has shown that there's much to look forward to from the company this summer and fall, and the fun's not over yet!

The Thunder network is an alternative network of nodes that lets you make off-chain bitcoin payments in seconds and settle back to the bitcoin blockchain every now and then. And it makes me excited about bitcoin all over again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sounds complicated but it's quite neat and could be a powerful innovation for bitcoin transactions. But first, let's take a step back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you've ever tried sending a couple of bitcoins from one wallet to another, you know it can take ten or twenty minutes before the blockchain confirms the transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reason behind this is that the blockchain is a network of servers that share the same record of transactions. When you send two bitcoins, all the nodes in the blockchain are going to write a line with this transaction so that everyone can confirm that the originating wallet has lost two bitcoins and the destination wallet now has two extra bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is great, and this is what makes bitcoin completely decentralized. But it's also slow, hard to scale and expensive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast year, Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja \u003ca href=\"https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf\"\u003ewrote a paper\u003c/a\u003e about bitcoin's scalability and speed issues, and defined Lightning networks. These alternative networks would run independently from the main bitcoin blockchain and would be able to register transactions in just a second. It uses smart contracts so that all nodes in a Lightning network don't need to be aware of \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYet, this was all theory. Blockchain hired Mats Jerratsch and started working on a sort of implementation of a Lightning network. This is what the company is announcing and open sourcing today. \u003ca href=\"https://www.blockchain.com/thunder\"\u003eThunder\u003c/a\u003e is the first implementation of a Lightning-like network. Blockchain is already running Thunder nodes and other bitcoin companies can look at the source code, provide Thunder wallets, adopt this network or fork it. Thunder can also work with other cryptocurrencies. And the startup made \u003ca href=\"https://blog.blockchain.com/2016/05/16/transaction-0/\"\u003ethe first live transaction on Thunder\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile Blockchain isn't going to use Thunder for Blockchain wallet users just yet, the startup is already thinking about real life advantages of a solution like Thunder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/screen-shot-2016-05-16-at-3-41-47-pm.png?w=1024\u0026amp;h=652\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Thunder, a transaction is so fast that the network can process 100,000 transactions per second. On average, Visa handles 2,000 transactions per second and the Visa network is capable of processing \u003ca href=\"https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/download/corporate/media/visa-fact-sheet-Jun2015.pdf\"\u003e56,000 transactions per second\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo put this into perspective, Blockchain wallet users are on track to make 40 million transactions this year, or around 1.3 transaction per second. Quite impressive, but let's be honest. While there are many other wallets out there, given that Blockchain is the most popular wallet maker, bitcoin transaction volume is very far behind Visa. The reason for this is that bitcoin transactions have been too cumbersome. So I'm convinced projects like Thunder are part of the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso important, transactions become much cheaper thanks to Thunder. When you settle back your Thunder payments to the bitcoin blockchain, there are still blockchain fees involved. But you can make many, many Thunder transactions before settling back to the blockchain - and Thunder transactions don't involve as many nodes. If you divide the fees by the number of Thunder transactions, paying using bitcoin becomes \u003cem\u003emuch\u003c/em\u003e cheaper. Fees are so cheap that you could finally imagine making microtransactions using bitcoins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Thunder would make bitcoin a viable alternative to Visa. It removes many of the limitations behind the existing bitcoin protocol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, there are still some roadblocks. Thunder can't work with anyone with a bitcoin wallet just yet as the bitcoin core development team needs to release \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoincore.org/en/2016/01/26/segwit-benefits/\"\u003esegregated witness\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0112.mediawiki\"\u003eCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY\u003c/a\u003e features. But the good news is that these features are on the roadmap and the core team wants to make Lightning networks possible. Until then, Thunder relies on trusted nodes. But with future bitcoin updates, Thunder can become a full-on Lightning network.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThunder is an exciting project and something that could drastically change some bitcoin use cases. Many have turned to alternative cryptocurrencies such as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum\"\u003eEther\u003c/a\u003e due to bitcoin's limitations. Slowly but surely, the bitcoin community is catching up and making bitcoin payments more attractive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003eFeatured Image: \u003ca href=\"http://perfecthue.com/\"\u003eJason Benjamin\u003c/a\u003e UNDER A Public Domain LICENSE\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/blockchain-open-sources-thunder-network-paving-the-way-for-instant-bitcoin-transactions/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/yxmcwgkywzocts6kwioj","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/yxmcwgkywzocts6kwioj"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:57.026-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:12.642-03:00"},{"id":460,"title":"20 Tweets That Are Too Real For Any Ladies Shopping In The Men's Section","description":"Ladies who seek out the comfiest shirts, only the most top quality pants, and the most badass of kicks: Listen up, gather around, let's talk. 1.

Natural language processing is entirely reliant on the data set it's trained on and it's this data set, specifically related to commerce intent, where he believes the startup has an advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, I can't help tease that this is the second pivot sanctioned by Hadzaad and that perhaps \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/07/30/gobutler-funding/\"\u003einvestors\u003c/a\u003e are getting tired of the change in strategy; a B2B company can look a lot less sexy from the outside than one that consumers directly interact with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"I know you could call it a pivot if you want to, although we're really still working on the same problem - offering consumers the most efficient way to express an intent and ultimately make a transaction,\" he says, kicking back a little.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The number-one thing shareholders are concerned with is that a company takes the best available path to success.

Separately, I'm hearing that Angel.ai has already struck deals with several companies in the travel and delivery space who will be launching new products over the next few months, although Hadzaad declined to comment on who or what they are. My understanding is that these won't necessarily be messenger app integrations per se, but that Angel.ai's tech could also surface in the form of a search box on a commerce company's website or a chat box within their existing app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our unique combination of AI scientists and product/business experts allows us to not act as a research lab, but as an AI company developing real products,\" adds Hadzaad. \"The fact that we have domain-specific models that are trained on millions of examples of consumers expressing specific domain intent in a message, differentiates us from other businesses in the space\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/angel-ai/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/hcwu8jxx9glgxjacuyz8","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/hcwu8jxx9glgxjacuyz8"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.965-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:12.040-03:00"},{"id":451,"title":"Can You Guess Which Prom Dress Is The Most Expensive?","description":"Let's dance!","content":null,"url":"https://www.buzzfeed.com/katieheaney/can-you-guess-which-prom-dress-is-the-most-expensive","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/jdrvtu8t6jiqqbbpjnbe","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/jdrvtu8t6jiqqbbpjnbe"},"publisher":{"id":5,"name":"BuzzFeed","slug":"buzzfeed","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.340-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.340-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.944-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:11.981-03:00"},{"id":450,"title":"The new 'MacGyver' is predictably crafty, possibly not old enough to drink","description":"CBS's new trailer for the new version of MacGyver is everything you might expect: action-packed, full of neat tricks and crowd-pleasing.

Snips is a personal assistant that helps you know where you need to be and when.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you first launch the app, Snips wants you to grant access to your location, calendars, contacts, motion sensor and Gmail account. Then you're good to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe main screen shows a tiny map at the top, a search bar in the middle and a list of events at the bottom. When you open the map, you can add layers of information. For instance, you can see your event locations, your favorite places, your friends' places, etc. I \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/mapstr-adds-directions-to-its-app-that-keeps-track-of-your-favorite-places/\"\u003elove maps\u003c/a\u003e, so I can see myself using this feature every now and then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe timeline at the bottom shows my next calendar events. If I tap on an event, I can see more information as well as the location of the event. Unfortunately, you can't edit the calendar event directly from this timeline view, which can be frustrating when you forgot to add the location of your next meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you tap on the location of your next event, you can start directions in Google Maps or open another app with this address using deep linking. Snips currently supports Citymapper, Uber, Waze and a few others. Oddly, Snips shows all the available apps by default even though I haven't installed eCab or Vianavigo. You can hide them in the settings, but this feature could have been more elegant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy ( \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/sunrise-will-sunset-on-august-31st/\"\u003enow defunct\u003c/a\u003e) favorite calendar app Sunrise was smart and only showed the apps you already have on your phone. Similarly, Citymapper is more powerful than Snips as it gives you an ETA as well as a price estimation so that you know if it makes more sense to order an Uber or take the subway. I don't see myself using Snips to move around Paris as I can open Citymapper from Fantastical in just one tap and get better ETAs. Snips would be an extra step.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd finally, you can search for restaurants, coffee shops or bars around this location with a few shortcuts at the bottom. Snips seems to be using the Foursquare API and displays results directly in the app. Once again, the results don't have a lot of information. You'll have to open the Foursquare app using deep linking to see tips or the menu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my timeline, I can also see my Eventbrite ticket for an event I'm attending tonight. Snips retrieved this information from my Gmail account. Over time, Snips is supposed to learn when I'm going to work and coming home and suggest these events in my timeline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen, there's the search bar. The search feature combines everything I've mentioned in a different way. You can search for calendar events, places, tickets or contact information. It's useful, but you'd expect more from a startup that \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/snips-ai\"\u003epromises\u003c/a\u003e to reinvent AI-powered assistants. I've been using the built-in Spotlight feature in iOS to get the same information, and it's not where iOS shines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there's a reason why Snips seems quite limited right now. Compared to other assistants, such as Google Now, Microsoft's Cortana, Facebook's M and Amazon's Alexa, Snips takes privacy very seriously and doesn't store your data on its servers. Everything happens on your phone, and you stay in control of your data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI'm in favor of taking privacy seriously. But this stance is also limiting. Siri and Snips share the same shortcomings - users \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything/\"\u003eexpect\u003c/a\u003e to be able to do complicated search queries that combine multiple web services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnips doesn't allow me to do that. It's just a central hub for all my calendar, contact and location data. But iOS has already been a good central hub for this data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Snips is in a corner right now as I don't see how it could become as powerful as Google Now or Alexa. It has already taken them years to come up with this app. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple are not going to slow down. The French startup first needs to implement natural language queries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSnips is tackling one of the toughest challenges in tech right now. Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are all working hard on improving their personal assistants. That's why it's good to see small companies innovating in this space, such as \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/09/siri-creator-shows-off-first-public-demo-of-viv-the-intelligent-interface-for-everything/\"\u003eViv\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/soundhound-launches-hound/\"\u003eHound\u003c/a\u003e and Snips.

Affirm gets a large, pre-existing customer base with whom it can offer financing, and Expedia and Eventbrite get to offer their customers a new payment option, which Affirm says typically leads to increased sales performance by retailers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut are one-time experiences really something consumers should finance? The answer is probably that it depends on when the actual experience is in relation to when you made the purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, it would be nice to pay over six months \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e you fly to that exotic country you've always been dying to visit.

With a tangible good, you continue to gain utility every day for months or even years after you've repaid the company. But with a vacation, shoppers may be more likely to leave Affirm on the hook for the balance of the trip when they are still paying a year after the experience they now barely remember.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe company's response to this is that they will be treating travel and ticketing the same way as material goods, and still will use \"thousands of data points\" to assess a consumer's ability to repay. And, if repayment trends do change, they will \"adjust their models accordingly to ensure they approve consumers in ways that maximize repayment rates\".\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/13/affirm-secures-100m-in-series-d-funding-to-expand-beyond-loans/\"\u003ewe've discussed before\u003c/a\u003e, high-interest rate financing plans like the ones offered by Affirm can be a sticky situation.  On one hand, there is a risk of customers using the service irresponsibly to finance nonessential items that they can't afford.

While Apple has recorded brisk iPhone sales in the last year,  it still has only a 2% share in the country's price-sensitive smartphone market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apple's investment in Bengaluru through its iOS Development Accelerator will have far-reaching effects for the area's rapidly growing and highly talented developer community,\" said NASSCOM President R Chandrashekhar. \"The skills and training they gain through this effort will significantly improve their app design and help them reach a broader market.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook is expected to announce a technology development centre in \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/02/16/apple-india-development-center/\"\u003eHyderabad\u003c/a\u003e, which was announced in February and is expected to work on Apple maps. The company is also likely to get the Indian government's approval on opening its first retail stores in the country. He will also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he had also met in the US last year. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCook has already compared India's large and growing market to China. \"I sort of view India as where China was seven to 10 years ago,\" he said last month. However, its growth in the country is likely to take time. Today's announcement is one step towards introducing more local content for Indians. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eHave something to add to this story?

These barriers-especially with online, soft goods retail-include correct sizing and shipping info for that gift. As Weisband and I discussed this he posed the question to me \"do you know your best friend's shirt size and their full address including zip code?\" I conceded that the answer was definitely \"no.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow Jifiti solves this problem is by creating two experiences: a gift sending experience and a gift receiving experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Sender\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e When a consumer sends a gift, they press the \"gift\" button at a Jifiti-partnered online merchant. This gift button is integrated into the merchant site or app with just a few lines of code. When the button is pressed, a new overlay window opens with a small form where the email address of the recipient and a note can be entered as well as scheduling info and payment for the item. This is where it gets a bit tricky. The item is not actually purchased, but rather the value of that item is generated into a gift card behind the scenes. All of this is packaged up into an email and sent to the recipient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/jifitis-new-messenger-chatbot-api-will-find-you-a-gift-even-when-youre-out-of-ideas/evitejifiti/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/evitejifiti.jpg?w=699\u0026amp;h=535\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Recipient\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e The gift recipient gets the previously generated email message in their inbox. When they open it, there is an unboxing animation and then a link to a web or app page where the gift that was chosen for them is displayed. At this point the recipient can choose the correct size they want and then enter the address where they want it shipped. Or, if they don't want that item, they can use the value of the gift card that came along with the gift to purchase something else.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt's All About Triggers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Strategically speaking, Weisband and team claim to have uncovered some of the behaviors that enable this gifting to work most successfully. Based on how he described this to me, I'm not sure I disagree. The team has found that gifting works best when there is a trigger-event or otherwise-that reminds senders to send gifts. This seems obvious, but again the team found an opportunity to streamline the process to make sending easier. Because of this insight, the company are focused on trigger-based platforms like events and gift registry experiences...hence their partnerships with Evite, 24me, and IKEA Registry among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir partnership and integration with these players' calendar and event-based sites and apps already allows trigger gift recommendations via the previously described procedure to instantly gift an item while it's all top-of-mind. Now, through their chatbot API, any brand already developing their own chatbot can easily integrate the Jifiti process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEverybody Wins\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e In this gifting scenario, a merchant sells the merchandise, Jifiti receives pay-on-performance gift card commission that they split with the company triggering the user to action (Evite, etc.). The sender had a quick, easy experience and the recipient gets a gift. Everybody seems to win.\u003cbr\u003e Jifiti also has a SaaS model for larger partnerships.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat looms in the near future is to see how this all plays out within chatbot experiences as they seem poised to gain traction with Facebook's muscle behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile Jifiti is capturing much information about which items are performing well as gifts, gender, location etc. (see the infographic below) which is sure to be useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Jifiti closed a Series A funding round of $3.3 million about 6 months ago led by Liberty Media (who interestingly owns Evite).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/jifitis-new-messenger-chatbot-api-will-find-you-a-gift-even-when-youre-out-of-ideas/jifiti_infographic-final/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/jifiti_infographic-final.jpg?w=506\u0026amp;h=1279\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/jifitis-new-messenger-chatbot-api-will-find-you-a-gift-even-when-youre-out-of-ideas/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/kcnzv5aj7dyj5sbzjqtj","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/kcnzv5aj7dyj5sbzjqtj"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.505-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:10.247-03:00"},{"id":412,"title":"Xiaomi's Apple TV rival streams 4K HDR video and runs on Android TV","description":"Chinese tech juggernaut Xiaomi may be best known for making high-quality smartphones like the new Mi 5 and selling them at low prices, but the company has made it very clear it wants to become a household electronics giant that can rumble with the likes of Samsung and Apple on a global scale.","content":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChinese tech juggernaut  \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/xiaomi-mi-box/mashable.com/category/xiaomi\"\u003eXiaomi\u003c/a\u003e may be best known for making high-quality smartphones like the new \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/03/22/xiaomi-mi-5-smartphone/\"\u003eMi 5\u003c/a\u003e and selling them at low prices, but the company has made it very clear it wants to become a household electronics giant that can rumble with the likes of Samsung and Apple on a global scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt Google's annual \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/xiaomi-mi-box/mashable.com/category/google-io\"\u003eI/O developer conference\u003c/a\u003e, Xiaomi announced plans to bring its Mi Box media streaming box to the U.S. first and to other regions afterwards.

Co-founder Alex Taub told me his goal with the premium features is to allow you to actually act on that data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most interesting addition is support for DM Campaigns. The idea is that once you've found valuable users, you can offer them a special deal or promotion - and since they follow you, you can do it right in their direct messages. SocialRank Premium allows you to send multiple DMs at once and automatically fill in things like the username.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaub said the aim isn't to support spammy, annoying campaigns that prompt people to unfollow you, but rather to allow businesses to send personalized messages to followers with whom they really want to build a relationship. So he said SocialRank is going to be careful in how it rolls out these campaigns and will initially cap the number of people you can message in a single campaign.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/socialrank-the-startup-that-analyzes-your-followers-adds-premium-features-and-pricing/socialrank-dm-campaign/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/socialrank-dm-campaign.png?w=680\u0026amp;h=347\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cp\u003eIn addition to DM Campaigns, the new features include an account summary that allows you to take a closer look at your follower data, for example looking at the geographic breakdown of all your followers who have the word \"engineer\" in their bio. You can then export that data to a PDF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, while the core SocialRank product is free, this isn't the first time the startup is charging for its products. It also offers a pricier Market Intelligence option, where large customers can see follower data for their competitors. SocialRank Premium, on the other hand, costs $49 a month.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Market intel is the enterprise product that brands pay a lot for,\" Taub said. \"With Premium, I think an individual social manager can pay fifty bucks a month.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/17/socialrank-the-startup-that-analyzes-your-followers-adds-premium-features-and-pricing/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/k6mudhntypw0ph32tksb","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/k6mudhntypw0ph32tksb"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.414-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:09.834-03:00"},{"id":398,"title":"'Stone Cold' Is A Pure, Uncut Slice of '90s Action Cinema","description":"John Stone (Brian Bosworth) in 'Stone Cold', John Stone (Brian Bosworth) in 'Stone Cold', courtesy of Stone Group Pictures \u0026 Vision International Stone Cold was not a hit by any stretch of the imagination when it arrived in theaters 25 years ago, accruing a box office take of only $9.3 million [...]","content":null,"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielbaldwin/2016/05/18/stone-cold-is-a-pure-uncut-slice-of-90s-action-cinema/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/xffzauk1w9douux07nat","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/xffzauk1w9douux07nat"},"publisher":{"id":3,"name":"Forbes","slug":"forbes","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.267-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.267-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.406-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:09.571-03:00"},{"id":397,"title":"Google Home isn't good news for Nest","description":"OK, Google, what's up with Nest?

Chromecasts are Internet set-top devices that, unlike Apple TV, don't really sit on top of or beside the TV, they tend to hang off an HDMI port. They give access to a world of Internet-based TV content, including Netflix and Hulu. His team also makes Chromecast Audio, which streams audio from your mobile devices to your favorite home speakers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis team sounds like the right one to build Google's first smart home device. I mean, who else would Google have used? I don't know. How about Nest?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNest is not a disinterested third-party. It is owned by Alphabet, Google's parent company and was bought when Google was still the overarching parent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's what Queiroz had to say about Nest:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"[Google Home] will support the most popular home networking systems so you can easily control your lights, thermostats, light switches and more, including our own Nest devices.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Google acknowledged that it owns Nest and that it will work with Google Home, but it was, at best, a \"by the way\" mention \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a Nest owner, the fact that Google let the Chromecast team design and build Google Home and is all but ignoring a sibling brand with extensive smart home chops is cause for concern. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eNest is not the chosen one\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy, you might wonder, wasn't it Nest CEO \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/category/tony-fadell/\"\u003eTony Fadell\u003c/a\u003e up on the Google I/O keynote stage introducing Google \u003ci\u003eNest\u003c/i\u003e Home?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApparently, that was at least partly Fadell's own fault. In March, \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2016/03/the-information-tony-fadell.pdf\"\u003eThe Information\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/i\u003ewrote an extensive report on Nest's struggles and how Fadell's approach to product development may be slowing the wheels of progress. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFadell wasn't shy about voicing his concerns, blaming too-rapid company growth and the new fiscal discipline at Alphabet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA1LzE4L2MwL0dvb2dsZUhvbWVQLmExNmEyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/b76ff43a/1ec/GoogleHomePurple.JPG\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFadell, though, is capable of designing and delivering exquisite products. Even before the extraordinary Nest thermostats, Fadell was known as the \" \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/03/01/ipod-iphone-rotary-dial-tony-fadell/\"\u003efather of the iPod\u003c/a\u003e.\" His design ethos and approach rather closely mirrors that of the late \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/category/steve-jobs/\"\u003eSteve Jobs\u003c/a\u003e. He worries endlessly over aesthetics and features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps if Fadell were still at Apple, that approach would be championed, but Google clearly felt the hot breath of Amazon on its neck. Google CEO Sundar Pichai even tipped his cap to the company when introducing Queiroz, who then announced Google Home: \"Credit to the team at Amazon for creating a lot of excitement in this space.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAmazon has reportedly already sold millions of Echos and Alexa, Amazon's direct Google Assistant competitor, is already spreading to \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/05/17/fire-tv-alexa/\"\u003eits other hardware\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/04/18/cowwatch-smartwatch-amazon-alexa-integration/\"\u003ethird-party devices\u003c/a\u003e.

We've done so with the sense - and proof - that this is an ecosystem. Nest hardware now all works with the same, single app. The devices are increasingly aware of each other. It's also open enough to work with third-party systems like Alexa. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Google went out of their way to show that Nest is a separate company, like Google,\" said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy, \"It has to be embarrassing to Nest to get pre-empted by Home and an indicator that Google's not waiting for Nest to build out their smart home vision.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoogle just sent a clear signal that Nest will have to go it alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy not going to Nest (or, probably more accurately, not waiting for Nest), Google's own smart home technology expert, Google just sent a clear signal that Nest will have to go it alone. Even though it's part of Alphabet/Google, the company with the most data and deepest machine learning and AI, Nest probably can't expect any better access to this intelligence than any other third-party partner. It looks like Nest will not have a seat at Google's smart home table. It will be less of a brother, and more of a distant cousin. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a reality that deeply shakes my confidence in Nest and its future and forces me to choose between Google's smart home ecosystem (clearly Google Home will have its own app - one of them being Chromecast) and Nest's.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf Google's lost confidence in Nest, how much support will the company get in the future? My hope now is that Alphabet sells them to someone who appreciates Fadell's approach to product. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIsn't Apple building some kind of \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/04/27/whats-next-for-apple/\"\u003eSiri Home Hub\u003c/a\u003e?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eHave something to add to this story?

Gadgets like the Echo and apps like Facebook Messenger aren't just popular services, they're changing the way we interact digitally. More to the point, they're shifting our experiences away from searching the web and apps themselves, areas that Google dominates, not to mention generate most of its revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Google is scared\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere's a reason people are turning away from traditional search and toward more and more new interfaces like voice interaction: convenience. When you need something - be it your calendar, a weather report, an Uber or even just a cat video - it's just simpler (or more \"natural\" in UI parlance) to ask for it, out loud, than to reach for a device and commence tapping, swiping and waiting for various screens to load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA1LzE5LzQ2L0FQXzU0MjI5MzA4LjgwNTFhLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/33b6876f/56e/AP_542293081710.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, Google's been doing voice and digital assistants for years, but today it showed it now understands playing the convenience game means more than just having good back-end technology. That tech also needs to have the right pathway to the user. That's one area the Echo got exactly right - it's the talking speaker we never knew we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Home and Allo, Google finally appears to have the right vehicles to meet users where they are, even if others got there first. Home is basically a clone of the Amazon Echo, but one of the Echo's weaknesses is that very little of our digital lives is lived on Amazon, so it relies on (often shaky) connections to other services to offer that full picture. With its ubiquitous services, Google is arguably in a better position to connect its smart speaker with our digital selves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Allo, Google may finally give people a reason to use a Google messaging app instead of Snapchat, WhatsApp, Slack or Viber.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Allo, Google may finally give people a reason to use a Google messaging app instead of Snapchat, WhatsApp, Slack, Viber or one of the many other messaging apps, all of which seem to work better than Hangouts. The wild card here is, again, the interactions (which are sort of like a supercharged Slackbot) that could keep users coming back simply because it's more convenient than launching a bunch of disparate apps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll of this, if it works, translates into more users spending more time in Google services - a trend that, as our reliance on traditional search declines, often points the other way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven Android Instant Apps is part of this. It's no coincidence that the demo started with a Google search, but ordinarily a user would have been directed to download an app, a permanent window in their home screen that leads to a service that Google is more than likely not a part of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Instant Apps, the search link still downloads an app, but it does so invisibly, gives the user the best experience, lets them pay for things with their Google account, and then it goes away - no permanent home screen real estate lost. Want to buy or do something else? Just come back to Google, and we'll handle it. Everybody wins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHistory is against Google\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, except for Facebook, or Microsoft, or Amazon - all of which are fighting this same war over consumer attention with their own platforms. Whether or not Google's I/O broadside will give it an edge depends on execution, and if history is any guide, it'll be a mixed bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA1LzE5LzQ4L0FQXzE2MTM5NzAxLjUzY2E0LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/559a5026/9ec/AP_16139701018510.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHangouts (which Allo and Duo essentially replace) and Google Now (which the \u003ca href=\"http://mashable.com/2016/05/18/google-assistant/\"\u003eGoogle assistant\u003c/a\u003e evolved from) were well-received when launched, but both have suffered confusing purposes and interfaces. Google Now isn't even a proper app on Android, and Hangouts is a confusing mess with an unsatisfying mix of features that don't compare well with what's available on other services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith its announcements at I/O 2016, Google has shown it's very much aware of this. It knows it let others take the lead in key product areas, which is why it didn't simply try to revamp Hangouts or wait for its sister company, Nest, to build a smart home hub. It didn't need to just show something new, it needed to show a new way of doing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt didn't need to just show something new, it needed to show a new way of doing things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt least that was the message; behind the scenes it may be another matter. Google is a sprawling, 60,000-person company with many disparate and sometimes redundant services, all glued onto the cash engine of search and ads. Are Allo, Home, Instant Apps and the new assistant just a shiny coat of paint on on the old Google? Or has it really turned a corner in its approach?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat's what will determine Google's fate in the next platform war. Not the Duo's knock-knock feature or Google Home's ability to understand small children or how many apps it recruits for its Instant Apps program. The tech was never the problem. Google needs to put the experience above all else - even above its aging search-and-ads business model. The feature Google needs to offer is seamlessness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly then will it have nothing to fear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eHave something to add to this story?

Fast forward to today and Hnetinka has teamed up with JustVacay founder Wilson Lee to launch  \u003ca href=\"https://www.darkstore.com/\"\u003eDarkstore\u003c/a\u003e, a delivery fulfillment platform for e-commerce brands that is already powering same-day delivery for mattress startup \u003ca href=\"https://www.tuftandneedle.com/\"\u003eTuft \u0026amp; Needle\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting today, anyone who wants to buy a Tuft \u0026amp; Needle mattress upon seeing it in the company's San Francisco showroom can get one delivered that same day, as long as they place the order before 4 p.m. Previously, it would take three to five days for delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkstore's target customers are direct-to-consumer e-commerce brands that don't have local, brick-and-mortar stores but are looking to ship their products quickly. Darkstore works by exploiting excess capacity in storage facilities, malls and bodegas and enables them to be fulfillment centers with just a smartphone, Hnetinka told me.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Uber is the largest transportation company that doesn't own a car Airbnb is the largest hospitality business that doesn't own a hotel,\" Hnetinka said. \"We're not going to take on real estate leases and we're not going to run these warehouses ourselves, so we want to be the largest fulfillment company that doesn't own a fulfillment center.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDarkstore doesn't charge brands anything to store inventory, but charges 3% per item that leaves Darkstore, with a minimum of $2 and a maximum of $20. With Tuft \u0026amp; Needle, which sells mattresses for about $750, Darkstore charges them $20 for every mattress that goes out. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor its first fulfillment center, Darkstore partnered with Storage SF, located in San Francisco's Dogpatch neighborhood. SF Storage typically charges $1.79 a square foot, but Darkstore figured out that it could get the storage company $7.70 per square foot. That's how they landed on a 70/30 revenue share, with 70% of the 3% Darkstore charges brands going to SF Storage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs long as Darkstore is picking the right brands, this model could work out pretty well for them. If Darkstore picks brands that don't already fulfill a certain number of orders per week, Darkstore could end up in a tough spot where it's storing all this inventory for free and not making any money because no one is buying anything from the brands. That said, Hnetinka says that before agreeing to store inventory for a brand, it confirms what the brand's current order volume is in a given city so that Darkstore can gauge how much product they'll move.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor deliveries, Darkstore partners with Berkeley, Calif.-based Axle Hire, which charges $5 per delivery for small items and $10 per delivery for something like a mattress. Each brand is responsible for paying the delivery fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, Darkstore is basically a platform that facilitates same-day delivery for e-commerce brands, and allows them to track their inventory, orders and deliveries. In order to get more brands on board, Darkstore is actively building plugins for e-commerce platforms like Magento, Shopify and BitCommerce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea for Darkstore came from a certain style of retail operations, called \"dark stores,\" in London and Taiwan. The dark store concept has not yet been brought to the U.S., Hnetinka said, and Darkstore wants to democratize it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"In Taiwan, the way it operates is, under bodegas there's extra space, so virtual retailers store their stuff there,\" Hnetinka said. \"That's where we got the idea to exploit excess capacity and not build the dark stores themselves.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith WunWun, the mission was to use stores as warehouses, which Hnetinka now says was a stop-gap. At the time, Hnetinka and the WunWun team were very tied to that mission. In hindsight, Hnetinka says he has realized that it's important to look further ahead and know that the mission can change because of something like the market landscape changing, with several other players coming in and raising a boatload of cash, like Postmates, UberRUSH and Instacart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"The other thing is, technology is moving so quickly that now, people are no longer buying stuff from stores offline,\" Hnetinka said. \"They're buying stuff from different guys. We look and see, what's not needed is to power offline stores online. What's needed is dark stores.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, a lot of startups and companies are caught up with powering offline stores online, with the exception of Amazon, Hnetinka said. In looking at why Amazon is so successful, Hnetinka says it's because Amazon gets you what you want, when you want it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"There's no other dark store-like solution that exists,\" Hnetinka said. \"So, you either sell through Amazon or you don't have fast delivery if you're a direct to consumer e-commerce company.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut, I wondered why e-commerce, direct-to-consumer brands \u003cem\u003ewouldn't\u003c/em\u003e just use Amazon. Well, for one, brands are at risk of losing brand equity because Amazon doesn't give much screen real estate to brands sold on its platform. Another reason, Hnetinka says, is because brands don't want Amazon to own and have access to all of their inventory and sales data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough Tuft \u0026amp; Needle sells its mattresses on Amazon, Darkstore is the only solution it can offer customers who walk into their show room and want to buy a mattress right away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Our customers wanted faster delivery, and we're excited to be working with Darkstore in order to provide them with the best experience,\" Tuft \u0026amp; Needle co-founder John Thomas Marino said via email. \"Our box is really convenient, but it's still a size that most last mile delivery companies can't deliver economically. We didn't think it would be beneficial to become experts in fulfillment services, and we were happy to partner with people who are, in order to offer same-day delivery.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo date, Darkstore has raised $150,000 from Gary Fritz, the former president of Expedia.com. The launch of Darkstore comes at a time when the on-demand market is hotter than it's ever been before. \u003ca href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/shopifys-online-merchants-can-now-offer-same-day-delivery-via-postmates/\"\u003ePostmates recently launched a partnership with Shopify to offer same-day deliveries\u003c/a\u003e of items for local shoppers and \u003ca href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2016/amazons-prime-now-comes-web-expanding-beyond-mobile-app/\"\u003eAmazon recently made an effort to highlight\u003c/a\u003e its one and two-hour delivery service Prime Now with its own dedicated website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"We think we can change the course of retail forever,\" Hnetinka said. \"And, in doing that, change the products that people have access to.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003eFeatured Image: Darkstore\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/wunwun-founder-lee-hnetinka-launches-darkstore-an-on-demand-delivery-fulfillment-platform/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/sjrod4ecyyubdgkywmle","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/sjrod4ecyyubdgkywmle"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.350-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:09.304-03:00"},{"id":388,"title":"A Guide To The New York Knicks' Visual Brand - In Photos: The New York Knicks' Visual Brand, Expanded","description":"Images will appear in order from oldest to most recent.

Never mind about the shiny bells and whistles involved with how it got produced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first few chapters of \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation-ebook/dp/B004J4XGN6?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;*Version*=1\u0026amp;*entries*=0\"\u003eThe Lean Startup\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://theleanstartup.com/\"\u003eEric Ries\u003c/a\u003e explains how they honed their process such that any developer could commit code to production on their first day at work. This does not mean they gave the new geek the keys to the kingdom and the power to destroy the service. It means the tech team has enough process in place, as well as checks-and-balances, that nobody can break things - not even a newbie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe challenge that many enterprises face is a lack of innovation and a slow response to change. Some large companies are trying to adopt \"agility at scale\" in the enterprise, or set up \"intrapreneuer\" programs to innovate. However, these enterprises tend to be the exception.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe upper hand startup companies have is that they have a chance to do it right the first time... but the reality is that many do not. The economics of time/talent/capital for startups means that most are running 5,000 MPH toward a goal - and leaving a wake of technical debt behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"But what is this 'doing it right'?\" you ask. Simply put, it means code that is continuously tested and integrated whenever an engineer commits code to the source repository. The most popular alternative is some mix of:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003edeveloper just tests it and/or,\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ethrow it over the wall to a QA team and/or,\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003ehave a \u003cem\u003e\"house party\"\u003c/em\u003e where the entire company tries to break the build on a staging server.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe adopted solution to house parties is automated user interface testing, aka: end-to-end, or functional testing. This is best achieved by building these tests from Day 1 of a project instead of waiting and back-filling them at a later point in time. Requirements or user stories are translated into tests that exercise each feature, under each possible user persona. Needless to say, I'm bullishly anti-house-party when it comes to testing for quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eA challenge with startups is that the product continually changes.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can have all of these awesome tests, and developers can certainly run them in their working environment, but the key is to continuously run them in a test server environment or a continuous integration (CI) server. Each time an engineer checks code into the repository, the CI server wakes up and gets to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIdeally, unit tests are run first, because they run much faster, and then the functional tests are run. For large applications, the CI server can break up and ideally parallelize the functional tests to save time. An automated test cycle that takes too long is not of use; I've put the upper bound at 15-20 minutes for a max test cycle. Obviously, shorter is always more productive for the team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy building these tests, an automated web browser can drive the user interface and make sure it  \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e works as intended. This keeps the codebase from moving backwards in production, and stops the presses until it's resolved, or until they \"fix the build.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany dev shops I've visited have a special monitor in the room that turns red, and I've seen a USB traffic light that is evidence of the build's health.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBesides environmental indicators of the build, I've seen other variations on maintaining quality - such as passing around a My Little Pony and placing it shamefully on the desk of the engineer who broke the build, such as the geeks do at Say Media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI prefer positive reinforcement - after the sprint demo, a medium-sized trophy adorned with Mardi Gras beads is awarded to the geek with the best feature of the week, such as the geeks do at Lyft.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe benefit of emphatic testing at the user-interface level is an increase in product quality. This is because each UI test is akin to  \u003cem\u003ea contract that cannot be broken\u003c/em\u003e. If the tests are evolving with the requirements, they serve as a watchdog to make sure we're not rolling backwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn chatting with geeks about where to spend the most time testing early on in a company or project, I always tilt toward the user interface because it inevitably exercises all the other layers. If the UI works, the underlying layers are probably doing it right.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe exception is where the product is an API, where unit tests are going to be the way to go. Really, in a perfect world, functional and unit tests should be in place from the get-go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA challenge with startups is that the product continually changes; that is often the byproduct of the Build/Measure/Learn cycle. Therefore, at what stage is it right to overlay end-to-end tests?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is an open-ended question that I still ponder. When a company  \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e has no idea of what it should build, it seems of limiting value because there probably are not enough users on the system where quality is of concern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the company knows what it needs to build, but the roadmap seems so daunting and talent so limited, it seems only natural to skip functional tests \"for now.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003eThe payout is clearly down the road on the efforts of good testing.\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut quality should ALWAYS be of concern, right? In the end, the trade-off is going to be a longer build cycle, but not 2x. I'd guesstimate it adds ~33 percent more to a project to have good functional and unit tests; therefore, on a two-week sprint this is at most days, not weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo rather than \"hurry up and get a product out there,\" I favor \"slow down and do it right, because we are probably living with the new features of this release for a long time.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe payout is clearly down the road on the efforts of good testing. It creates a codebase that is delightful to work with for future engineers. It creates a codebase which lives longer, is easier to refactor and can stand the test of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea that I'd like to leave behind for startup founders and lead techies is to \"Please! Please! Test Your User Interface.\" Do this early in your progression and the payouts will be plentiful down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003csmall\u003eFeatured Image: \u003ca href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/gallery-879871p1.html\"\u003eBenoit Daoust\u003c/a\u003e/\u003ca href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com\"\u003eShutterstock\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/small\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","url":"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/right-sizing-the-development-process-for-startups/","image":{"url":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/cjsbdp3sopb4vpcozj4m","thumb":"http://res.cloudinary.com/dt7iowhph/image/upload/c_fit,dpr_auto,f_auto,h_200,w_200/cjsbdp3sopb4vpcozj4m"},"publisher":{"id":2,"name":"TechCrunch","slug":"techcrunch","created_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T16:10:15.241-03:00"},"created_at":"2016-05-18T23:55:56.321-03:00","updated_at":"2016-05-18T23:56:09.092-03:00"},{"id":383,"title":"Can Jeff Hornacek Save The New York Knicks?","description":"The Knicks are gambling on Jeff Hornacek.

One of the greatest linebackers in modern NFL history,  Willis made the Pro Bowl in seven of his eight professional seasons.  Then he shocked the football world when he walked away from the game in March 2015 at age 30.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Willis' life is - well, probably not at all what most NFL fans would expect.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMonday through Friday, Willis commutes to work at a Silicon Valley office park. He's got a list of favorite lunch spots nearby. Sometimes he takes video calls from home, or instant messages with colleagues after hours.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike so many people who share his age range and geographic area, Willis now works at a tech startup.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWillis picked cotton as a kid in Tennessee to help support his family. He and his siblings later moved in with a basketball coach to flee an abusive, alcoholic father. But sports - he was a two-time collegiate All-American at Ole Miss before the NFL - offered salvation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow Willis sees something different in the business world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"People always told me when I was growing up that if you want to be something great, you have to be this physical specimen that can jump up to here and all that,\" Willis told \u003ci\u003eMashable\u003c/i\u003e in an interview this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSeated in a conference room at the office of \u003ca href=\"https://www.opensourcestorage.com/\"\u003eOpen Source Storage\u003c/a\u003e, his new employer, Willis still sported the bulging physique of an NFL star. But dressed in tan pants and a black T-shirt, his outfit could have been that of any other Silicon Valley tech worker. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \"For me, this is an opportunity to be able to tell young kids that you can be more than just a physical specimen to be great,\" Willis said. \"I'm a person that can't speak about something until I've done it myself.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut Willis' remarkable story of empowerment and reinvention might not have happened this way at all. It begins with a chance encounter between Willis and a Silicon Valley entrepreneur whose journey has much in common with Willis' own path to the NFL.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eA legendary career abbreviated\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eForged by his tough childhood and propelled by prodigious athletic gifts, Willis became an instant star for the San Francisco 49ers after the team drafted him 11th overall out of Ole Miss in 2007.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe racked up 950 tackles for the Niners, plus 20.5 sacks, eight interceptions and 16 forced fumbles. He terrorized opposing offenses from sideline to sideline, all the while acting as an on-field general for the San Francisco defense. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis February, \u003ci\u003eAthlon \u003c/i\u003eranked Willis the 22nd-best linebacker in NFL history - a plaudit that's double impressive when you consider his career lasted half as long as those of some other players. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen in March 2015, Willis shocked the world by retiring after the 49ers hastily called a press conference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe was only 30 years old, but Willis' rationale was simple. A career of injuries made him worry his elite days were behind him, and he didn't want to sustain more longterm physical damage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Honestly, I pay attention to guys when they're finished playing, walking around like they've got no hips and they can't play with their kids.

He grew up in the area, but dropped out of high school and didn't attend college. He did odd jobs like washing dishes to get by. He lived out of his car for a period as a teenager.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Apple's Steve Jobs Would See Himself in Tech Pioneer Eren Niazi,\" squawked a headline on \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/12722957/1/apples-steve-jobs-would-see-himself-in-tech-pioneer-eren-niazi.html\"\u003eTheStreet\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e two years ago. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradual grinding and bold ambition helped Niazi get a foothold in the tech industry. He began on the business side for Fry's Electronics and Circuit City, then launched Open Source Storage in 2001 while still in his early 20s. He was later pushed out of his own creation, but then relaunched it in 2013. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiazi and Willis, both extremely successful men from different fields, also happened to live in the same Silicon Valley neighborhood. Several months before he retired, Willis was recovering from a surgical operation when Niazi spotted him wrestling to move bags from his car to front door. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Usually when people walk up to me, they kind of already know who I am and have some motive,\" Willis recalled this week. \"But he just insisted like, 'Let me help you with that.' Then he just took off. I thought it was cool.\" \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiazi wasn't being polite or nonchalant, though. He doesn't follow sports and has never been to a 49ers game. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe simply had no idea who Willis was. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the two neighbors got to know one another more, Willis found himself impressed by Niazi's rags-to-riches story and tech-industry success. Niazi, in turn, was impressed by the traits that made Willis an NFL star, as well as the player's curiosity for life beyond football. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout two months after he announced his retirement from the NFL, Willis signed on full-time with Open Source Storage as a board member and executive vice president for partnerships. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHe's got the LinkedIn page and everything. \u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE2LzA1LzE4Lzk0L1dpbGxpc0xpbmtlLjU1YzA3LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTEyMDB4OTYwMD4/7365fc03/bda/WillisLinked.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHearing Willis and Niazi discuss their working relationship - after years of watching Willis deliver bone-crushing NFL hits - is surreal.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere's Niazi: \"A lot of guys come in with a big ego, but Patrick's not like that. He's just a total pleasure to work with.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now Willis: \"It just felt like, a lot of times in my other occupation, it was all about you as an individual. Here, I'm part of a team in a little bit of a different way.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike the many apps and games that have made technology a popular phenomenon, Open Source Storage a behind-the-scenes player. Basically, the company provides storage and infrastructure solutions to other companies. (Niazi's original iteration of the company worked with Shutterfly, Friendster and Facebook, among others.) It currently has about 60 employees, some full-time and some on contract. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Carrie Pendolino, the company's current vice president for marketing, applied for an opening last December, both Willis and Niazi interviewed her. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\"Then I came home and my husband and son were like, 'Uh, do you know who that \u003ci\u003ewas\u003c/i\u003e?!?'\" Pendolino recalled recently. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's a situation others can likely relate to; Willis is involved in interviewing most of the company's prospective hires. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe still works out, and he fishes sometimes, too. But that's Willis' life these days: A full-on Silicon Valley tech worker. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe watched some NFL highlights this past season - his first away from the sport - and caught bits and pieces of random games here and there.
